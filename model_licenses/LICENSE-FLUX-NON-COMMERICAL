FLUX Non-Commercial License v2.1

Black Forest Labs Inc. (“we” or “our” or “Company”) is pleased to make the weights, parameters, and inference code for the FLUX Model (as defined below) freely available for your non-commercial and non-production use as set forth in this FLUX Non-Commercial License (“License”).  “FLUX Model” includes, individually and collectively, the models denoted as FLUX.x [dev], where “.x” denotes the FLUX Model version number, and models made available under the License, as indicated by a license notice that is included in or attached to the work, and their elements which includes algorithms, software, checkpoints, parameters, source code (inference code, evaluation code, and if applicable, fine-tuning code) and any other materials associated with the FLUX AI models made available by Company under this License, including if any, the technical documentation, manuals, and instructions for the use and operation thereof. Note that we may also make available certain elements of what is included in the definition of “FLUX Model” under a separate license, such as the inference code, and nothing in this License will be deemed to restrict or limit any other licenses granted by us in such elements.

By downloading, accessing, using, Distributing (as defined below), or creating a Derivative (as defined below) of the FLUX Model, you agree to the terms of this License. If you do not agree to this License, then you do not have any rights to access, use, Distribute or create a Derivative of the FLUX Model and you must immediately cease using the FLUX Model. If you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant to us that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this License. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License or access the FLUX Model on behalf of your employer or other entity.

 1. Definitions.
 - a. “Derivative”  means any (i) modified version of the FLUX Model (including but not limited to any customized or fine-tuned version thereof), (ii) work based on the FLUX Model, or (iii) any other derivative work thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Outputs are not considered Derivatives under this License.
 - b. “Distribution” or “Distribute” or “Distributing” means providing or making available, by any means, a copy of the FLUX Model and/or the Derivatives as the case may be.
 - c. “Non-Commercial Purpose” means any of the following uses, but only so far as you do not receive any direct or indirect payment arising from the use of the FLUX Model, Derivatives, or Content Filters (as defined below): (i) personal use for research, experimentation, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, or otherwise not directly or indirectly connected to any commercial activities, business operations, or employment responsibilities; (ii) use by commercial or for-profit entities for testing, evaluation, or non-commercial research and development in a non-production environment; and (iii) use by any charitable organization for charitable purposes, or for testing or evaluation. For clarity, use (a) for revenue-generating activity, (b) in direct interactions with or that has impact on end users, or (c) to train, fine tune, or distill other models for commercial use, in each case, is not a Non-Commercial Purpose.
 - d. “Outputs” means any content generated by the operation of the FLUX Model or Derivatives from an input (such as an image input) or prompt (i.e., text instructions) provided by users. For the avoidance of doubt, Outputs do not include any components of the FLUX Model, such as any fine-tuned versions of the FLUX Model, the weights, or parameters.
 - e.   “you” or “your” means the individual or entity entering into this License with Company.

2. License Grant.
- a. License. Subject to your compliance with this License, Company grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, royalty free, and limited license to access, use, create Derivatives of, and Distribute the FLUX Model and Derivatives solely for your Non-Commercial Purposes. The foregoing license is personal to you, and you may not assign or sublicense this License or any other rights or obligations under this License without Company’s prior written consent; any such assignment or sublicense will be void and will automatically and immediately terminate this License.  Any restrictions set forth herein regarding the FLUX Model also apply to any Derivative you create or that are created on your behalf.
- b. Non-Commercial Use Only.  You may only access, use, Distribute, or create Derivatives of the FLUX Model or Derivatives for Non-Commercial Purposes.  If you want to use a FLUX Model or a Derivative for any purpose that is not expressly authorized under this License, such as for a commercial activity, you must request a license from Company, which Company may grant to you in Company’s sole discretion and which additional use may be subject to a fee, royalty or other revenue share. Please see https://bfl.ai/licensing if you would like a commercial license.
- c. Reserved Rights. The grant of rights expressly set forth in this License are the complete grant of rights to use the FLUX Model, and no other licenses are granted, whether by waiver, estoppel, implication, equity, or otherwise. Company and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted by this License.
- d. Outputs. We claim no ownership rights in and to the Outputs. You are solely responsible for the Outputs you generate and their subsequent uses in accordance with this License. You may use Output for any purpose (including for commercial purposes), except as expressly prohibited herein. You may not use the Output to train, fine-tune, or distill a model that is competitive with a FLUX Model.
- e. You may access, use, Distribute, or create Output of the FLUX Model or Derivatives if you: (i) (A) implement and maintain content filtering measures (“Content Filters”) for your use of the FLUX Model or Derivatives to prevent the creation, display, transmission, generation, or dissemination of unlawful or infringing content, which may include Content Filters that we may make available for use with the FLUX Model (“Provided Content Filters”), or (B) ensure Output undergoes review for unlawful or infringing content before public or non-public distribution, display, transmission or dissemination; and (ii) ensure Output includes disclosure (or other indication) that the Output was generated or modified using artificial intelligence technologies to the extent required under applicable law.

3. Distribution. Subject to this License, you may Distribute copies of the FLUX Model and/or Derivatives made by you, under the following conditions:
